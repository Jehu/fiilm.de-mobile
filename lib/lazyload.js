/*
There are some serious issues with load order when loading multiple JavaScript files and depending
on this 'load order' IN ANY WAY in either 'page internal scripts' or other JavaScript external
files, which are loaded separately.
(After all, it's not all the time that you can dump all JS loads together in one flattened
external {script}...)

So what we have to do here (in the backend, generating the JS output sent to the browser/client
requesting the lazyload.js file) is add a piece of code invoking a predefined function made 
available in the page loading the lazyload.js file. This can be accomplished using, for example,
the same methods used by google in their translation API: there, the backend/server accepts an 
optional 'cb' argument pointing to the function which must be run next to execute/complete
the lazy-load cycle. See this example usage of their translator JavaScript code:

    {script}
	### code located in the page itself
    function googleTranslateElementInit()
    {
        new google.translate.TranslateElement({
                pageLanguage: 'en',
                layout: google.translate.TranslateElement.InlineLayout.HORIZONTAL
            }, 'google_translate_element');
    }
    {/script}
	### loading the JS file; theirs is element.js, we would be loading lazyload.js now:
    {script src="//translate.google.com/translate_a/element.js?cb=googleTranslateElementInit"}{/script}

--- 
	
When you have a situation where the backend is not able or cannot otherwise be expected to run code to
'augment' the JS output, you can still accomplish this goal by augmenting this lazyload.js file by
hand. For instance, you might add the following bit of code at very END of each of your JS files to 
ensure a successful lazyload process under all circumstances. Note that this bit is a basic example 
of what you might do:

// we code for a default callback here with a quite unique name:
//    ccms_lazyload_setup_GHO();
// If that function exists, it is executed at the end of this script.
// (And yes, we can assume the function exists when it is contained 
//  in the HTML page itself.)
//
// See also:
//    http://www.electrictoolbox.com/check-javascript-function-exists/
// except for his mistake to check like this:
//    if (window.function_name) ...
// instead of using the typeof, the idea is good.
//
// This check and invocation MUST happen in this lazyload.js: we can only guarantee this lazy loader
// is indeed 'loaded' itself, when it is the ONLY external JavaScript file we depend on in our HTML page.
// 
// From here, the lazy loader will take over and make sure the other scripts get loaded and in the
// prescribed order!

if (typeof window.ccms_lazyload_setup_GHO == 'function')
{
    window.ccms_lazyload_setup_GHO('lazyload.js');
}
